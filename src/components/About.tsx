              </h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Founded by Chef Marco Benedetti, Bella Vista began as a small family restaurant 
                with a simple mission: to share the authentic flavors of Italy with our community. 
                Over the years, we've evolved while staying true to our roots.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Today, under the guidance of Executive Chef Isabella Romano, we continue to push 
                culinary boundaries while honoring the timeless techniques that have made Italian 
                cuisine beloved worldwide.

                Our Philosophy
              </h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                We believe that dining is more than just eatingâ€”it's about creating memories, 
                celebrating life's special moments, and bringing people together around exceptional food.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Every ingredient is carefully selected, every dish thoughtfully prepared, and every 
                guest treated like family. This is the Bella Vista way.
